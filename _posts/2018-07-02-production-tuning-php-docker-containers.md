Docker is a powerful way to run the same packaged code in both development and production, but it can be a bit tricky to understand how to optimize PHP Docker images for production.

In this screencast, I'll walk you through some of the techniques you can use to construct Docker PHP images in a way that allows you the full flexibility you need in development, without sacrificing the performance you need to get out of your PHP containers running in production.

We'll use a Laravel PHP project to walk through some common steps I take to optimize my applications for production.
