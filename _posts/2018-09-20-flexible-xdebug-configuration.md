This screencast is part of my Docker for PHP Developers Complete Video Bundle course.

One of my favorite patterns for making Docker PHP images as flexible as possible is using environment to dynamically set PHP INI configuration. In this screencast, I use XDebug to demonstrate how you can make your INI configuration flexible with environment variables. This technique allows each developer to customize his or her settings, and works well for modules that need changes between development and production.

If you enjoyed this screencast, check out my new video course [Docker for PHP Developers](https://bitpress.io/docker-for-php-developers/). Iâ€™ve distilled three years of learning into an eight-hour course and a 220-page book, that I think will help you learn marketable skills that you can start using at your job right away!
